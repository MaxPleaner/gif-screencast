# gif-screencast
wrapper for some shell commands

Credit for this code goes to http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/165147/65890

This is tested on Linux Mint (Ubuntu) and requires FFMpeg to be installed. I did so by downloaded one of their releases and following their instructions to compile and install.

It also requires ffcast to be installed.

Note that the third line of the script (optimizing the gif) takes a long time on my computer, and I've experienced the `convert` command eating my cpu. If you get bored you can stop the script at this point and try to use the unoptimized gif.
